# Wearable Game Controllers: Halloween Edition
Wednesday, October 30, 2019, 6:30pm - 9:30pm
DMG Workshop • At the Toronto Media Arts Centre (32 Lisgar Street)

Want to make wearable game controllers that can be played with your friends? How about vampire capes, witches’ hats, and zombie bandages as game interfaces?

In this workshop, you will learn to design and make multiplayer wearable game controllers. Since it’s the day before Halloween, we’ll use that as our theme. We’ll have Halloween-ish wearables available that you can mod, but you’re also invited to bring your own! We will use conductive fabric and Arduino to create bespoke games interfaces that you can wear.

No previous experience with Arduino or electronics is required.
